\noindent Wasps \textcolor{red}{aren't evil}. Many are territorial and their queens, commonly about in spring and fall, are protective of their eggs. \\\\
\noindent Wasps are \textcolor{colour1}{essential} to a healthy ecosystem. They prey on smaller insects and \textcolor{colour1}{pollinate}. Wasps enjoy their personal space: perhaps you were stung when close to a groundnest!

%center phylogeny

\noindent Ants and bees are close relatives of wasps. Bees ancestors were predatory, but wasps retained (and are excellent at) hunting. Some wasps can latch onto and \textcolor{colour1}{decapitate} their prey mid-air. \\\\
\noindent Wasp \textcolor{colour1}{diversity} is staggering. There are more species of ichneumonid wasps than \textcolor{colour1}{vertebrates} (that's every mammal, fish, bird, and reptile).\\\\
You may resume hating when the next vespid stings you unprovokedâ€” that may be longer than you think!
